# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word,  and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.
In this project, computer randomly selects a word and a player tries to guess it.

## Milestone1
Here, I have used python language to implement this game.

## Milestone2

Here I have created two functions.
1)ask_for_input() function: It takes a single alphabet as input from the user
2)check_guess() function: It checks if the letter is in the word.
User is given 3 attempts to guess the correct word.
